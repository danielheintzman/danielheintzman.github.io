      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Mailchimp specializes in building software for small business owners to grow their business. A significant
        portion of Mailchimpâ€™s customers are solopreneurs who have limited time to devote to marketing their business.
        User research found that many of these solopreneurs wish they could run more marketing campaigns using
        Mailchimp but they find it challenging to constantly be coming up with new ideas for marketing campaigns while
        they are focused on running their business.
      </p>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        The goal for this project was to encourage Mailchimp customers to try out the company's new products; such as 
        Postcards, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and Instagram Ads. By reducing the friction in the workflow creating marketing 
        campaigns, it was proposed that this new solution would save time for customers and help Mailchimp see greater 
        user retention on the platform.
      </p>
      <h2>Team & Role</h2>
      <p>
        At Mailchimp, I was a member of the Innovation Experiences Team. The team is responsible for prototyping future
        vision projects and testing them to determine whether they are worth pursuing on a larger scale.<br><br>Efforts
        towards this project were largely independent, where I took the lead on taking the idea from concept to
        completion while receiving feedback from colleagues on my team and relevant stakeholders. The team's consistent
        feedback throughout the design process was key to the success of this project.
      </p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        An iterative design process was followed consisting of a
        number of design methods. It began by defining the goals & anti-goals, success metrics, customer group of focus
        and, analysis of secondary research. Many stakeholders were interviewed with participants from a range of
        different teams and roles including product designers, researchers, developers, content strategists, and product
        managers all of which work on different parts of the product such as Growth, Email, Marketing, and Landing Pages.
        Key learnings from these stakeholder interviews and secondary research were consolidated through a thematic
        analysis. This led to a prompt for a design studio that involved eight product designers ideating different
        design directions. Sacrificial concept testing was then conducted based on learnings from the team design studio
        and tested with actual Mailchimp users. Finally, a number of prototypes were developed until a final proposed
        design was created after multiple design critiques.
      </p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <div class="contact-text">
        <p>In the end, this project was proposed to the Mailchimp executive team and successfully prioritized for development. Today, the project is now live as a new feature called Mailchimp Auto Designer. Read the press release:
