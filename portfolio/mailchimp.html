      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Mailchimp specializes at building software for small business owners to grow their business. A significant
        portion of Mailchimpâ€™s customers are solopreneurs who have limited time to devote to marketing their business.
        User research has found that many of these solopreneurs wish they could run more marketing campaigns using
        Mailchimp but they find it challenging to constantly be coming up with new ideas for marketing campaigns while
        they are focused on running the rest of their business.
      </p>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        The goal for this project was to completely rethink how creating a marketing campaign on Mailchimp works in
        order to empower users to create more marketing campaigns on the platform. As a result, by helping Mailchimp
        users more conveniently run marketing campaigns to grow their business, Mailchimp would also benefit from seeing
        an increase in user activation on the platform.
      </p>
      <h2>Team & Role</h2>
      <p>
        At Mailchimp, I was a member of the Innovation Experiences Team. The team is responsible for prototyping future
        vision projects and testing them to determine whether they are worth pursing on a larger scale.<br><br>Efforts
        towards this project were largely independent, where I took the lead on taking the idea from concept to
        completion while receiving feedback from colleagues on my team and relevant stakeholders. Their constant
        feedback throughout the design process was key to the success of project.
      </p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        Over the course of four weeks working on this project, an iterative design process was followed consisting of a
        number of design methods. It began by defining the goals & anti-goals, success metrics, customer group of focus
        and analysis of secondary research. Many stakeholders were interviewed with participants from a range of
        different teams and roles including product designers, researchers, developers, content strategists and product
        managers all of which work on different parts of the product such as Growth, Email, Marketing and Landing Pages.
        Key learnings from these stakeholder interviews and secondary research was consolidated through a thematic
        analysis. This led to a prompt for a design studio which involved eight product designers ideating different
        design directions. Sacrificial concept testing was then conducted based on learnings from the team design studio
        and tested with actual Mailchimp users. Finally, a number of prototypes were developed until a final proposed
        design was created after multiple design critiques.
      </p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <div class="contact-text">
        <p>In the end, this project was successfully assigned to a cross-functional team, where a significant portion of
          the design was fully built and can be seen in the Mailchimp product today. To read a press release on this
