      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        The motivation for this project stems from user research which showed that users find the process of finding
        landing page templates on Mailchimp overwhelming and confusing. They're not entirely sure what the differences
        are between each of the templates and how the differences can be utilized as a catalyst for their marketing
        needs. From a purely visual perspective, listing templates in a simple thumbnail and grid layout is a disservice
        to the well crafted templates.
      </p>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Since great intent and craft was put into designing the templates offered by Mailchimp previously, it makes
        sense to identify and inform users why they should utilize a specific template over another.<br><br>
        Therefore, the goal for this project was to craft an experience that not only showcases Mailchimpâ€™s templates,
        but also communicates what makes them uniquely useful, and also help assist the user with their
        selection.<br><br>
        Not only would this help existing customers, but by surfacing the templates on the marketing site before a user
        registers with Mailchimp, this could ultimately result in being able to convert organic searches directly to
        Mailchimp users. This was a significant opportunity since at the time Mailchimp was the third result in a Google
        search for "landing pages".
      </p>
      <h2>Team & Role</h2>
      <p>
        At Mailchimp, I was a member of the Innovation Experiences Team. The team is responsible for prototyping future
        vision projects and testing them to determine whether they are worth pursuing on a larger scale. The team takes
        a 0-to-1 approach to developing new ideas.<br><br>
        This project was a joint collaboration between myself and another product designer also on the Innovation
        Experiences team. In addition to this collaboration, we constantly received valuable feedback from other team
        members and stakeholders which was vital towards making this project a success.
      </p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the four weeks working on this project, a number of design methods were utilized along the way to
        reach a final proposed solution. The design process began by defining the customer, goals, antigoals, and
        potential use cases. User research related to the project was collected and stakeholder interviews were
        conducted. These stakeholder interviews aided in building partnerships with other departments who would be
        responsible for building out the concepts we designed on a large-scale. To better understand Mailchimp and its
        position in the market, the existing user flow on Mailchimp was assessed and compared to analgous experiences
        through feature benchmarking. These early exercises helped define the core user problem and scoped the project
        into a clear focus. Potential solutions were then explored through a design studio where ten product designers
        developed a number of different approaches to solving a related prompt. Based on this design studio, a variety
        of different prototypes were created based on the strongest design directions and were iterated on in between
        design critique sessions in the subsequent weeks. Finally, user testing was conducted on the final prototype and
        documented with learnings for future cross-functional teams to learn from.
      </p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <div class="contact-text">
        <p>The intention of this project was to explore the potential of what templates on Mailchimp could look like in an
          ideal scenario, not necessarily what it will look like. With that said, this project was a success because it
          served as intended. In the end, the project became a source for inspiration for many concepts that were later
          introduced on the Mailchimp platform in the months following. For example, shortly following this project
          Mailchimp introduced landing page templates which utilizes many of the ideas that were proposed in this project
