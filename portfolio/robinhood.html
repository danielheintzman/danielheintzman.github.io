      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>At Robinhood, I had the opportunity to
        work on a variety of new projects including features before the launch of two new products: Robinhood Crypto and
        Robinhood's web app.</p>
      <p>In addition to these new products, one problem area I focused on involved helping the subset of Robinhood
        customers
        who sign
        up to Robinhood but don’t end up investing with the product.</p>
      <p>In the end, a solution for three key areas of the product was designed to make picking investment
        opportunities easier
        to understand, accessible, and more convenient.</p>
      <h2>Problems uncovered from user research</h2>
      <p>As with many mobile apps, a portion of Robinhood’s user base is taken up by inactive users. In the
        months
        leading up to this project, a study by our user research team was conducted in order to understand the
        underlying
        reasons
        behind why Robinhood new users become inactive. Reading through these findings, I learned when new users are
        looking
        to invest, their main hurdle is deciding which stock they should invest in first. There seemed to be two main
        reasons
        for this: </p>

      <p>The first reason was that Robinhood lacked the tools necessary for users to discover stocks on their own. When
        users
        are first using the product, it is very common for them to say "I don’t know what stocks are available to invest
        in on the app".</p>
      <p>
        The second reason was due to users lacking confidence. With the exception of current and former professional
        traders,
        almost all users say they are "not an expert" and don’t feel educated enough to invest for themselves.
      </p>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>These two problems of stock discovery and user confidence informed the goals for this project. </p>
      <p>The first goal was to enable new users to easily find different stocks to invest in. The second was to improve
        education
        in order to help users feel confident and empowered enough to invest themselves.</p>
      <h2>Understanding where we’ve been</h2>
      <p>Previously, work had been done towards helping users discover what stocks are available to invest in on the
        app. Specifically, in the months leading up to this
        project,
        a feature on Robinhood for Web called Collections had been designed.</p>
      <p>Collections is a feature that helps users discover different investment opportunities by allowing users to
        search
        through
        different curated lists of stocks that relate in some fashion. </p>
      <p>Prior research regarding Collections on the web product was overall positive with there being many active users
        of it.
        On the web product, Collections exist in three locations: on a stock detail, in search, and in a collection list
        view.</p>

      <p>With this existing design for Collections on the web product, it was decided to not go through an end-to-end
        design process towards addressing the first user problem of discovery again. Instead, it was decided to
        introduce discovery to
        mobile by creating parity with the web product and bring Collections to iOS and Android.</p>
      <h2>Previous design on mobile</h2>
      <p>Below shows what the initial design looked like before this project, where both iOS and Android apps did not
        have Collections yet.</p>

      <h2>Creating parity between web and mobile</h2>
      <p>The process of designing Collections for both iOS and Android largely consisted of designing different
        iterations
        for
        how the pill-shaped buttons would work on mobile while following design principles from Apple’s iOS Human
        Interface
        Guidelines and Google’s Material Design Guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Design process for solving user confidence</h2>
      <p>Once this initial portion of the project was complete and we had launched Collections on iOS and Android, it
        was
        time
        to begin thinking about how we can introduce education in order to help build user confidence; as outlined
        earlier, this was the second core problem many churning users faced. </p>
      <p>This process consisted of a combination of reading user research, analyzing products from other companies that
        successfully
        engage users during discovery, developing prototypes that attempt to help users learn more about investing, and
        consolidating
        learnings from feedback received on those prototyped ideas.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, this project was cut short due to the Collections portion of this project being re-scoped to
        include additional features. With that said, our team learned a ton about how we can bring this
        aspect of user education to discovery. </p>
      <p>For example, one prototype that was well-received is an idea that teaches users, on the empty-state of search,
        different
        investment strategies that are common for other investors that have similar goals and investment experience.</p>

      <p>Inspiration for these prototypes came from an earlier project I worked on at Robinhood where we came up with
        a design that surfaces Collections on the homescreen of the web product, as shown below.</p>

      <h2>Key learnings and future improvements</h2>
      <p>With much excitement, the first portion of this project of bringing Collections to iOS and Android was launched
        in the
        final few days I was at the company. This did, however, mean I was unable to see the impact Collections had on
        metrics.
      </p>
      <p>Overall, internal feedback was positive and there was a feeling of enthusiasm to continue improving this area
        of
        the product.
        I’m excited to see where the product goes in the future, especially in terms of improving user education and
        evolving the way we help users to discover different ways to make money through investing.</p>
