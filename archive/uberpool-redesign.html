      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p class="sub">Empowering long distance travellers to plan trips together</p>
      <p>
        When I tried using uberPOOL for the first time a couple of months ago in Toronto, I became an instant fan. Sharing
        a car with someone else, personally, was totally worth the convenience of better price. UberPOOL’s mission of
        cutting congestion, pollution and parking by turning every car into a shared car aligns with how I believe the
        world is going to work in the future with the introduction of driverless cars. One way that I believe Uber should
        expand their outreach of this initiative is by focusing on the needs of unique niche markets and then once the
        system is perfected, expand to other markets with similar needs. One specific market that I have found reason to
        believe has potential is focusing on university students. Below I have put together a case study for how Uber
        could expand its efforts in uberPOOL.
      </p>
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p class="sub">Students are getting the short end of the stick</p>
      <p>
        The transportation system that students use to travel between home and university is flawed in many ways. Focusing
        on the province of Ontario in Canada, a large proportion of students going to university in Ontario are from the
        city of Toronto. In fact, roughly 50% of the population of Ontario lives in Toronto. With this many people having
        a home in the city of Toronto, it is a common occurrence to have university students needing a way to go back and
        forth from their university and home. Personally like the large majority of students at University of Waterloo, as
        a student living in Toronto, Canada, I very frequently have to experience the burden of organizing a ride for
        myself to or from school. Currently, no platform has successfully solved this problem that many thousands of
        students in North America have of going to an from university.
      </p>
      <h2>The Goal</h2>
      <p class="sub">Focus on university students as a niche target market</p>

      <h2>Market Research</h2>
      <p class="sub">Current products just aren't solving the problem</p>
      <p>
        While there are a few possible options for travelling to and from university, the main downside to the
        reasonably-priced existing options is that students must find their own transportation to one of the 2 pick-up
        locations within the city of Toronto. This is especially difficult for international students who don’t have
        family to drive them to a nearby pick-up location and therefore end up requiring to also take an additional mode
        of transportation, such as public transit to their nearest pick-up location. As outlined below, students are
        wanting a to be picked-up from a location that is not far from their current location while keeping a reasonable
        price. This has naturally introduced the uprising of students sharing rides, who connect through Facebook,
        within the past few years which has brought along a few problems of its own.
      </p>
      <h3>Intercity bus services</h3>
      <p>
        For many years, taking an intercity bus from the city of Toronto to your respective university has been the
        standard method of transportation. However, with the inconvenience that comes with it, it is starting to become
        less and less popular with respect to students using ridesharing groups on Facebook.
      </p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <p>The cost for a bus ride to school is generally priced reasonably for students and on par with the pricing of
        joining a carpool on Ridesharing Groups on Facebook. A trip from downtown Toronto to University of Waterloo
        will cost you around $20.</p>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <p>Student riders need to go through the hassle getting to the bus station, paying for their ticket, waiting
        for bus to arrive, then arriving at their school to walk to their place of residence.</p>
      <h3>Taxi services</h3>
      <p>
        While taking a taxi is likely to be by far the least popular method of transportation for students travelling to
        university, it is important to consider so that it is clear what the underlying reasons why the majority of
        students do not prefer this option.
      </p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <p>Student riders may prefer this option if they need to carry lots of luggage such as when moving in or out of
        residence or travelling to and from the airport.</p>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <p>This is the most expensive option for students. A trip from downtown Toronto to University of Waterloo will
        cost you over $200.</p>
      <h3>uberPOOL</h3>
      <p>Since uberPOOL will generally be unavailable for the time and distance that is requested by a student needs to
        go 100km+ to their school, the student rider may opt to ride an uberX to school.</p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <p>Student riders will be able to enjoy the ease of being picked up from their home or wherever location is
        most convenient.</p>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <p>Student riders want to ride with other students so they can meet and spend the long drive with another
        fellow student from their school. <br>
        Both student riders and drivers usually don’t have a strong preference for time of day they would like to be
        picked up. <br>
        Student riders will need to pay at least 10x the price to ride in an uberX vs. catching a ride from a fellow
        student from Facebook Ridesharing Group. A trip from downtown Toronto to University of Waterloo will cost you
        over $100.<br>
        Students going up to school will generally only need 1 seat. Students would likely rather save money and wait the
        extra time to pick up other passengers rather than pay for the extra seats for additional passengers.
      </p>
      <h3>Ridesharing Groups on Facebook</h3>
      <p>
        The fastest growing option amongst students, nowadays, is students connecting with other students through a
        ridesharing group on Facebook, where student drivers can connect with students who need to travel to and from the
        university. All the major universities in the province of Ontario have active ridesharing groups where students
        can connect with each other. While this is currently the best option for most students, it is nowhere near a
        perfect system and many improvements can be made in favor of both student drivers and riders.
      </p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <p>The cost for a bus ride to school is generally priced reasonably for students and on par with the pricing of
        joining a carpool on Ridesharing Groups on Facebook. A trip from downtown Toronto to University of Waterloo will
        cost you around $20.</p>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <p>Ridesharing groups is a cumbersome system where drivers have to add their post to the other hundreds of other
        daily posts that other student drivers post resulting in their post being seen and not getting riders. <br>
        Student drivers need to comment on their post once they have received enough riders or are not driving anymore so
        they don’t receive unnecessary messages. On the other hand, student riders sometimes spend time unnecessarily
        messaging drivers who are . <br>
        Student drivers need to go through the hassle of contacting the student riders.

      <h2>Business Goals</h2>
      <p class="sub">Solving this problem to support Uber's mission</p>
      <p>
        From my prior projects I have learned the importance of always knowing the overall business goals of any project
        initiative within a company. The 3 important areas that I have found can help push new projects forward is by
        focusing
        on how a new initiative can: stem losses, increase revenue or help the company be a leader in their industry by
        introducing
        new product capabilities. The following demonstrates the business objectives that a project like this would
        positively
        impact Uber’s bottom line.
      </p>
      <h3>New Users</h3>
      <p>By focusing on university students as the target market for this project Uber will be able to capture more of the
        upcoming, younger generation of consumers.</p>
      <h3>Increased engagement</h3>
      <p>Similar to uberCOMMUTE, this project allows Uber to benefit from users coming back and using the platform since
        drivers and riders who consistently travel to and from school and enjoy the experience will return whenever they
        plan a trip. This benefit of having recurring user engagement could also result in drivers and users could be a
        good way of introducing new users to the platform who may have not been previously open to using Uber products.
      </p>
      <h3>Greater environmental impact</h3>
      <p>Introducing this project would contribute towards uberPOOL’s mission of cutting congestion and pollution on the
        roads since student drivers who previously would drive to and from school by themselves would now be sharing their
        vehicle with other people.
      </p>
      <h3>Industry leadership</h3>
      <p>Finally, this initiative would enable Uber to further its presence as an industry leader by introducing a new
        means of providing reliable transportation to an area that no notable company has successfully solved.
      </p>
      <h2>User Goals</h2>
      <p class="sub">Student riders and drivers collectively want a better way to come together</p>
      <p>
        During the market research phase, I noticed that not only do student riders want a way to connect with drivers but
        student drivers who have already planned a trip to travel a far distance are also interested in being able to
        connect with potential riders. This is demonstrated when student drivers on ridesharing groups make postings
        indicating that they are travelling a certain direction and ask if there are any riders that are interested in
        joining. This therefore proved there to be 2 types of students that would benefit from being able to connect over
        Uber for long distance trips to and from school.

      <h2>User Task Flow</h2>
      <p class="sub">Crafting a solution that integrates well and makes sense</p>
      <p>
        For most of my design projects, before diving into figuring out how anything is going to be designed, I try to
        stay as low-fidelity as possible. I find this important when starting any project so I can easily make on the fly
        and can make sure the overall architecture of the project integrates well with the rest of the project. In the
        below user-task flows I attempted to find the optimal workflow that balanced a great user-experience, by requiring
        the least amount of user input, and technical effort, while respecting the good design work that Uber already
        created.

      <h2>Final Design</h2>
      <p class="sub">Considering every use case, leaving no scenario left to chance</p>
      <p>
        After finalizing the optimal user task flow, I made specific changes to the user interface with care while noting
        down the reasoning behind every design decision to keep the design thorough down to the last detail. I find this
        can be helpful when presenting a new a significant amount of changes to the user experience to a team to show
        which possibilities have been considered. Below, highlighted in blue, are the changes that I would recommend so
        that the user needs discussed earlier are accommodated.
