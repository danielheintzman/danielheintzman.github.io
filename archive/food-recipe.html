      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p class="sub">Rethinking the way meals are prepared</p>
      <p>
        As part of a weekend design challenge I participated in I was tasked to design an application that allows people
        to discover, save, and share their favorite recipes. For this challenge, I was given the requirements the
        application should allow users the ability to find, save, and share recipes. Additionally, the design must
        include a recipes details and/or search page.Â My end goal for this project was to rethink the conventional way
        people prepare their meals by helping people learn to create new delicious meals.
      </p>
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p class="sub">There is too many recipe options to choose from</p>
      <p>
        Before diving into a solution to understand the problem, I noted down the many of the problems I personally
        endure every day when preparing food. The first problem that I had that related preparing my meals was that I
        often waste a lot of time looking at recipes with ingredients that I do not like or do not usually like to buy,
        in turn wasting time looking at recipes for meals I would never consider in the first place. Secondly, I wanted
        to see reviews from others who have tried cooking the recipe I am considering before. Finally, the last major
        problem that experienced was that I would often hear from friends and family that they tried cooking a certain
        recipe they found online that they enjoy it so much they make it every few days and I would value a way to be
        able see what recipes my friends and family recommend.
      </p>
      <h2>The Goal</h2>
      <p class="sub">Make discovering new recipes quick and personalized</p>
      <p>
        The instructions for this design challenge consisted of creating either a mobile or web application recipes
        detail and/or search page. Each recipe needed to have a title, multiple photos, a description, a shopping
        list,
        a how to section, share options, a rating, multiple reviews and user uploaded photos. Additional elements were
        encouraged to be added without the use of user research to assess my product thinking. Finally, the task did
        not
        encompass designing a complete flow but solely the essential features; meaning are encouraged areas such as
        account creation did not have to be addressed.
      </p>
      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p class="sub">Learning to think from someone else's shoes</p>
      <p>
        For this project, I worked as the sole product designer. I used this exercise to exercise my UX skills and
        tested what areas of my UX process are the most effective and what areas could be improved.
      </p>
      <h2>Business Goals</h2>
      <p class="sub">Providing enough value for users to consistently return</p>
      <p>
        For this challenge two business goals were outlined as being the most important to keep in mind. The first was
        to focus on user engagement by encouraging users to come back to the app every day. The next goal was to
        optimize the design to get users to share the recipe with others that may or may not be on the platform
        currently would be encouraged to use the application.
      </p>
      <h2>User Goals</h2>
      <p class="sub">Keeping the user in mind throughout the entire design process</p>
      <p>
        Given that I did not have the opportunity to conduct user interviews with users of the existing app, I
        prioritized my assumptions and tradeoffs using a proto-persona. I often find thinking through who I believe
        would be a target customer would be, with a proto-persona, is helpful in a couple ways when I don't have time
        or
        the availability of actual people. First I can gain an understanding of what a typical person that would be
        interested in a product like this is frustrated currently with their existing products allows me ensure I do
        not
        make the same mistakes in my design. Likewise, utilizing a proto-persona helps with understanding potential
        user
        needs and goals clarifies what features need to prioritized in my design.

      <h2>Storyboards</h2>
      <p class="sub">Understanding how users would interact with the app every day</p>
      <p>
        Now that I have got a clear understanding of a potential feels about the problem space that I am tackling, I
        created to 2 storyboards that demonstrate how a potential user would achieve their 2 largest goals. The first,
        allowing users to save their favorite recipes they have discovered and adding it to a grocery list for them to
        quickly check when they are in the grocery store. The second main user goal that I discovered was important to
        address was providing users the ability to share their experience with their food creation with friends and
        family.

        created a user task flow that demonstrate how a potential user would achieve their 2 largest goals.

      <h2>Experience Mapping</h2>
      <p class="sub">Architecting what configuration of the app provides the optimal user experience</p>
      <p>
        My next step after understanding how a potential user would intuitively achieve their goals, I went into depth
        into how those actions would translate into a user interface.

      <h2>Final design</h2>
      <p class="sub">Ensuring every component and feature fulfills a meaningful purpose</p>
      <p>
        In the final design after the preliminary UX stages, I concluded that breaking up the task flow into 3 simple
        steps; personalize, discover, and save would make the process the most logical to end users. Starting with the
        first step, personalize, I designed this phase of the user experience to allow users to input what kind of
        meals
        they want to receive recommendations for. This was particularly important since as discovered when thinking
        about the goals of a potential user,potential users would not want to see recipes that they would not be
        interested in the first place due to their own preferences. Secondly, I wanted to make searching through
        recipes
        to be as efficient as possible. I therefore, prioritized making images as a major focus so users can quickly
        scan through photos of recipes without much mental effort. The final stage of the user experience was to
        provide
        as much control for the user to perform tasks they might want to complete. Experiences like being able to add
        ingredients to your grocery list, tracking your progress in the recipe instructions, or being able to see what
        other people think about the recipe you are considering were all designed so that users have freedom over what
        they would like to do with the app.
